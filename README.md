# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is accessible at [https://nelkalm.github.io/personal-website/](https://nelkalm.github.io/personal-website/).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can clone the repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/nelkalm/personal-website.git

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

## Running the Website

Once you have cloned or downloaded the repository, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.

## Editing the Website

To edit the website, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in the `src` directory. Once you have made your changes, you can test them by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Deploying the Website

If you want to host the website on your own server or a different hosting service, you can simply copy the contents of the `src` directory to your desired location. You may also need to modify the paths to the CSS and JavaScript files in the HTML files.

If you want to host the website on GitHub Pages like I do, you can follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Rename the forked repository to `<your-username>.github.io`.
3. Modify the website as desired in the `src` directory.
4. Commit your changes and push them to the `main` branch.
5. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy your website.
